    "dbdesc":["Greetings!", "It gives me great pleasure to inform you that Dr. Joy A. Thomas has been selected to be a recipient of the OBA Lifetime Achievement Award – 2021.", 
    "Every year, the Old Boys’ Association recognizes Old Boys who have gone above and beyond the call of duty in the true spirit of Fide et Labore, and Old Boys from around the world nominate achievers from amongst our midst to be recognized by the OBA. Earlier this year, you had nominated Dr. Thomas for the award, with Ajit Paranjpe and Prasad Akella as supporting nominators. While it is unfortunate that Dr. Thomas is being recognized posthumously, we are proud that he has achieved so much, has won and spread our School’s renown, and that he has well and truly enriched her crown.",
    "Normally, the award is presented on OBA Day on the first Sunday of September. However, owing to the Covid-19 pandemic and related situations, it is unclear when we will celebrate OBA Day. Once decided, I shall be sure to keep you informed.",
    "Yours sincerely, In Faith & Toil,",
